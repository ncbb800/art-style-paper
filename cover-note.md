# Cover Note — Shawn

This packet is a **starter draft** of your paper, built from your `paper-starter.md`. It is not a model answer and it is not the final version. Your job over the next four sessions is to make it yours. Three moves do that.

## Anchor

Your `AnimeSceneWriter` Space is currently SLEEPING and was previously RUNTIME_ERROR. That is fine for the paper — the project does not require a working hosted Space of your own. What it requires is **one real prompt grid you actually ran**, with outputs you can point at.

 I was wondering if I could just delete the stand-alone ones and make 
- Pick three models from your collection that give you the comparison: a strong general-purpose one (FLUX.1-dev or SDXL), a style-tuned one (animagine-xl), and one more of your choice. Find each one's hosted demo Space on Hugging Face — most popular models have one linked from their model card.
- Pick **two scenes** and **three styles** — your choice, but the example grid in `PAPER.md` section 3 is a reasonable starting shape (train station at midnight, market street after rain; styles like anime, surrealist, noir).
- Run each prompt through each model's hosted Space. Screenshot or download the outputs. Pick the two or three clearest examples of the **specialization tradeoff** — places where the style-tuned model did better inside its lane but worse outside it.
- Replace the example outputs in `PAPER.md` section 4 with your real ones (described or linked, since this is a Markdown paper). Keep your real model names and your real prompts.

This is real evidence and it's gathered with tools you already know how to use. No setup tax.

## Stretch — the build-vs-use gap

This is your tier's third bullet, and it's where your `AnimeSceneWriter` Space stops being a limitation and becomes a research finding.

The hosted demos let you compare models on output quality. But they can't tell you what a *student-builder* can put on a public Space. That's a different question, and it's one your own work has already started answering: you tried to build a style-tuned Space, and on free CPU it ran into a runtime error. That gap — between what the hosted demos can do (paid GPUs, optimized inference, full model weights) and what you can deploy on free Hugging Face hardware — is itself a real finding worth reporting.

The move:

- Pick one prompt from your grid and run it through a hosted demo. Save the output.
- Try to run the same prompt through a small style-tuned model that *will* run on free CPU — something like a smaller animagine variant, a quantized SDXL, or a distilled image model. (We can pick one together.)
- Compare the outputs. Compare the wait times. Compare what broke.
- Add a third axis to the paper's findings: **fidelity (general vs. style-tuned), flexibility (in-style vs. out-of-style), and accessibility (hosted demo vs. student build).** One paragraph in section 4 reporting what the gap actually looks like at a student level.

That third axis is the part of the paper nobody else in the cohort can write. The hosted-demo work is what every reader of an image-generation paper would do; the build-vs-use comparison is what *you* can write because you tried to build it.

If time runs short, skip the stretch. The Anchor work — three models, two scenes, three styles, real outputs — is the priority and stands on its own.

## Voice

Three paragraphs to rewrite in our working session:

1. **Section 1 introduction.** Your real motivation is the curation work — you've been collecting style-relevant models since March, and the project came out of noticing differences between them. Say that. The introduction should sound like a curator who started running tests, not like a generic study of image generation.
2. **Section 3 method.** Your existing journal already shows methodological care (you talk about training data quality, model architecture differences, and prompt engineering challenges). Bring that voice into the paper — explain *why* you're comparing a general-purpose model with a style-tuned one, in your own words.
3. **Section 5 limitations.** Real limitations to name in your voice: small prompt grid (you tested a handful of scene/style combinations, not dozens), single rater (you, eyeballing the outputs), no automated style-similarity scoring, and the gap in your journal between Week 2 and Week 3. The AnimeSceneWriter instability does *not* belong in limitations any longer — it's a finding now, reported in section 4 as the build-vs-use gap. Naming what didn't go smoothly makes the paper more credible.

Tell me each one out loud first, then we rewrite together.

## Optional second extension — prompt complexity

If the Anchor work goes smoothly and you have appetite for one more move beyond the Stretch above, run the same scene at two prompt-complexity levels — "a noir alley at night" vs. "a noir alley at night, low-key lighting, wet pavement reflecting neon, two figures in silhouette under a streetlamp" — and see whether the style-tuned model's specialization advantage grows or shrinks with prompt complexity. One paragraph in section 4. This is a real but optional extension; the build-vs-use stretch above is the higher-priority move because nobody else in the cohort can write it.

## Two housekeeping nudges

**Journal continuity.** Your journal currently skips Week 2 (you have Week 1 in the README and Week 3 in a separate file). Either backfill Week 2 with a short entry, or restructure the journal so the gap doesn't show. An admissions reader looking at the repo will notice missing weeks.

**Source verification.** The candidate references in `PAPER.md` are abstract-checked only, via Consensus. Verify each one before you keep it: title, authors, venue, and what the paper actually claims. The image-generation literature changes fast; some of these may already have updated versions you'd rather cite.
